why english ? because the chinese support in the ubuntu is so poor. after many work,I only can type chinese in the terminal, but can't input chinese in the firefox and vscode.

## how to install clash?

even though you can insatll clash through `go cmd` like `$ go install github.com/Dreamacro/clash@latest` , but there are so many dns and sfw problem that we always get a **time out** result. so the best install method is download release from [https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash/releases](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash/releases) and build ourselves.  `
clash-linux-386-v1.10.6.gz ` and `
clash-linux-amd64-v1.10.6.gz ` are both work.

we use `clash-linux-amd64-v1.10.6.gz` go on . wait it download completed. extract the `.gz file` .  `cd clash-linux-amd64-v1.10.6`,because the runable file name is too long , `mv [name] clash`. and try to run it `./clash`. it will generate a `config.yaml` in the `~/.config/clash/` dir. 

## how to configue 

open your proxy provider website , copy the subscribe link and open it in the new tab. then add a `&flag=clash` in the url end. download the website and rename it to `config.yaml`. replace the source file and run clash again.

## how to auto run with boot?

```bash
# create service
sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/clash.service

# edit
sudo vim  /etc/systemd/system/clash.service

# input
[Unit] 
Description=clash daemon  
[Service]

# :wq!

# run
# refresh the config file

```
